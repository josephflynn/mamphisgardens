                <p class="showDates"><font color="black">Then is a group exhibition comprising twelve local and international artists. All artists were asked to select work(s) from 2018, aiming to create a personal timeline guided by a specific moment, emotion or feeling. Then rejects temporal boundaries, dismissing the often linear, sequential or thematic structure of the gallery-museum format. It beckons artists to produce their own narrative of 2018 in a way personally meaningful to them.<br/><br/>

                This exhibition takes places on the stolen land of the Woi Wurrung peoples and the Boon Wurrung peoples of the Kulin Nation. We pay respects to elders past, present and emerging including all other Indigenous peoples. Sovereignty has never been ceded.<br/><br/>


                This exhibition has a TW: sexual assault, rape, trauma.<br/><br/>

                Jorinde Olling<br/><br/>Looking back on 2018, there are certain moments in time that changed Jorinde. That opened her up, allowing a truer version of herself to emerge. Where energy shifted. Where she intuitively had to grab a piece of paper to let out her feelings. These are the moments that make up Then.<br/>https://jorindeolling.com/<br/><br/>

                Nindya Nareswari<br/><br/>
                Nindya entered another world through polarization of light. This alternate world amazed her with its wonderful colours and reminded her of the concept of dualism. Everything in the world has two sides: mind-matter, positive-negative. This world taught her never to judge upon first glance; she believes we may find treasures behind the facade.<br/>https://www.nindyanareswari.com/<br/><br/>

                Tabitha Swanson<br/><br/>
                Memories. Moments of self-reflection. A composite of past lives and self-portraits. A year in review, made anew.<br/>Insta: tabithaswanson_<br/><br/>

                Cassandra Smith<br/><br/>
                Cassandra has been bathing since before birth, just like you, in the womb. It is a life practice, we know how to bathe like we know how to sleep and eat. For Then, a suite of ambiguously shaped bronze objects desiring to accompany you in your bathing practice will be re-introduced to a gallery setting, Memphis Projects. They are available for short-term rent - enquire via cassandrasmith.info or @waterlifebathhouse on instagram. Water Life ~ Bathing Objects was originally shown at Mailbox Art Space in 2018.

                Claire Neale & Phoebe Witts<br/><br/>
                Both Phoebe and Claire’s 2018 involved negative emotions arising from their respective experiences with the working sphere and the disruptions that occurred in their personal lives. They struggled to work out what they wanted in a time of great transition from the familiar, to the pressures of the uncertain and new. These anxieties were juxtaposed for both Phoebe and Claire with finding refuge in the intimacy and closeness of personal relationships. Their work expresses these themes through a collaborative project, starting with poems Phoebe wrote throughout 2018. Claire used these as inspiration for a series of collages that simultaneously interpreted the poems and express her own similar feelings from the year.

                Elena McGannon<br/><br/>
                Hello Again is a recollection of moments of desperate preservation and emotional intimacy throughout 2018. It comprises a small selection of moments within which Elena felt irrefutably present, and aggressively hopes to preserve for fear of losing their memory, or the lives connected to the images. Accompanied by free-form entries from her journal, the work grapples with the difficulty of engaging in remembrance without appropriation.

                Indiah Money<br/><br/>
                The pieces chosen for the show relate to the motion of continuously working through traumas - both intergenerational trauma and lived trauma. Indiah painted these pieces in 2018 when needing to focus on healing herself and the wounds that continue to affect her life.

                Kirsty McKellar<br/><br/>
                Martinstraße has been constructed to remember a feeling that lasted the better part of six months. This was the period Kirsty lived in her apartment in Steglitz, Berlin. The feeling was bathed in other emotions: excitement, elation, satisfaction, gratitude, anguish, despair, anxiety. Despite this feeling being concealed by layers of emotion or caked in her own self-doubt, hope – and therefore the ability to hope for something – was the consistent feeling that helped her work toward attaining contentment.

                Sault (Anna Durham)<br/><br/>
                This piece is a linear improvised music work crafted from vocal recordings re-sampled from Sault’s forthcoming debut album, Echoes of Intimacy. 2018 was a year of change and shift for Sault’s creative process. A fascination with cybernetic feminism, and the human singing voice, led to an exploration of feminine and technological embodiment. In turn, this interest in digitally facilitated vocal masquerade led to an alternate, more minimal approach to song writing. Crafting Echoes of Intimacy was both a cathartic and technically challenging experience; this re-imagined interpretation of the album is symbolic of the significance that the voice and technology held to Sault’s practice throughout 2018.

                Sophie McKellar<br/><br/>
                Hör auf is a work created during Sophie’s stay in Berlin, depicting the trauma of rape. The German term 'hör auf!'' is a command phrase that translates to "stop!", "knock it off!" or "drop it!". The connotations of these words fall on a spectrum from serious to playful. The name was chosen as a deliberate comment on the way victims of sexual assault are oftentimes blamed for the incident which they have endured: accused of teasing or saying stop in jest.

                Tara Sutherland<br/><br/>
                The pieces on display have been taken from Tara’s graduate collection entitled FORMATION and were created and developed over the course of 2018. The garments represent significant moments in time for Tara as a designer: in their inception, creation and showcasing at Melbourne Fashion Week. This event was her first introduction to the fashion community and will forever be etched in her memory.
