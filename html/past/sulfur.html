                "Down-time is hard to justify," he said "no matter what we do, we must do something… even a crime, any crime, is preferable to complete inactivity, which is the most detestable thing in the world."<br/><br/>


                Tell her she works at Tesco's<br/>

                Tell her who doesn't know<br/>

                Tell her they realise it's all decalali<br/>

                Out in the party pack<br/>

                Phensic and marmalade<br/><br/>


                This is not food or water, nor sex or sleep<br/>

                Rather it's a reaction to the metal in my blood.<br/><br/>


                The stone melts like wax but the dripping is a peculiar thick fire<br/>

                At the surface, in the light, fluorescent bloom<br/>

                "It's different from what I expected," she said.<br/><br/></font><br/><br/><font color="#515151">Kane Alexander<br/><br/>Kane Alexander is a Melbourne based artist working primarily with photography and sculpture. His work presents sublime landscapes from remote places around the world.<br/><br/>Various in-camera techniques are used to connect viewers, immersing and allowing onlookers to experience as if present in the landscape. The use of fog on windows, motion blur, and double exposures are examples of these methods. Some works entail the creation and placement of sculptural responses in landscapes or crisp hyper real representations of complete moments in nature.<br/><br/>While instinctually influenced by nature and the human condition, Alexander's work also draws from romanticism, surrealism, land art and contemporary art movements.<br/><br/>Kane Alexander has exhibited in Australia and abroad. Kane was the winner of the CCP Patrick Corrigan AM Acquisitive Award in 2010, the RMIT Peoples Choice Award, and been a finalist in several prestigious visual arts awards. His work has been reviewed by the Age Newspaper (Melbourne) on several occasions and published in magazines and online. Alexander's work has been acquired by the City of Whitehorse, the Maroondah City Council (Melbourne) and The City Museum Kathmandu (Nepal), as well as Private Collections in Australia and Internationally.<br/><br/>He recently launched the art project space, 222 Rosslyn Gallery. Kane has curated two multidisciplinary group exhibitions in the gallery; Shifting Spaces and Hyper. <br/><br/>As a third generation artist, Kane Alexander continues to explore interpretations of the world and experience, through the ongoing study of techniques, subject and place.<br/><br/>

                Joseph Flynn<br/><br/>
                Joseph Flynn works in a number of different materials from drawing to painting, sculpture, and much more his artwork is focused with the way in which society navigates the recent shift into our ever increasingly technological environment.<br/><br/>Flynn completed a Master of Contemporary Art from the VCA in 2017 as well as founding and running Memphis Gardens. He has directed and assisted with a number of galleries around Melbourne. He has exhibited in over 35 various group exhibitions and 13 solo shows since 2008.<br/><br/>

                Phebe Parisia<br/><br/>
                Phebe Parisia generates abstract installations and assemblages that examine the relationship between materiality, action and affect. Her works feature evolving assemblages and configurations of utilitarian synthetic materials including synthetic industrial fabrics, nylon objects and permanent marker actioned repetitive line worked panels.<br/><br/>The work often involves the creation of temporary structural devices or motifs such as screens, walls or altered picture frames within the space, which 'perform' a permanence or solidity. However, this sense of stability in the work is undermined by soft fabric, seemingly impermanent or unstable additions/subtractions and the visually jarring patterns enacted by the artist’s obsessive process of line drawing. Invoking historical precedents including Process art and Minimalism, Parisia's work expresses an anxious integration of seemingly binary visual forms or experiences.<br/><br/>Parisia has exhibited in Australia and overseas. Her work is held in private collections in Australia, Iceland and Finland.<br/><br/>

                Tom Pendergast<br/><br/>
                Creating objects and images in a variety of media, Melbourne artist Tom Pendergast crafts totems of pleasure and guilt—pulling inspiration from designer goods, sticky sweet meats and breads and sexual gadgets. Exploring various cultural responses to so called "guilty" pleasures, Pendergast infuses his flashy, urethane cast breakfast foods and painted portraits with thoughtful criticism, pulled from various essays on queer and feminist theory. Consumptive goods and sexualized bodies become one in the same for Pendergast, who re-contextualizes both treasured and mundane objects with the same symbolic aplomb.
