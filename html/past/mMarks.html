                  "Making Marks" is the debut group exhibition from Memphis Projects, the gallery space for Memphis Gardens, a new creative studio in Abbotsford. </font><br/><br/><font color="#515151">The first act of creating a painting involves making a mark on a surface. The way a work develops depends on a series of these marks; thick, refined, expressive, minute, etc. all associated together to create a composition, a picture, an aura. "Making Marks" comprises artists from differing styles who share in this common action. The exhibition celebrates the uniqueness that each artist brings to the indefatigable collective gesture. <br/><br/>This exhibition will host a variety of paintings from studio residents and associated local artists with a dance performance by Megan Payne and Leah Landau on opening night.  <br/><br/>

<font color="black">Leah Landau and Megan Payne</font><br/>
Leah Landau and Megan Payne are Melbourne based dancers / choreographers. Their performance for the opening is a choreography driven by external suggestions and good advice.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Brendan Coghlan</font><br/>
Brendan Coghlan is a multi-disciplinary artist and designer, covering a range of skills from brand experience through illustration to painted signage. A recent RMIT graduate of a Masters Degree in Communication Design, Coghlan has recently been most been interested in the relationship between traditional design technique and neighbourhood parochialism. Always hand paint.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Joseph Flynn</font><br/>
Joseph's work examines the relationship between the traditional methods of art making and the new digital world we all now find ourselves in. Joseph works with an extensive range of digital and non digital meduims including web developement, 3D printing, painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, image manipulation and 3D animation software. He recently completed a Master of Contemporary Art at the Victorian College of the Arts and has exhibtied extensively throughout Melbourne, Lisbon and Dallas, Texas.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Andrew Clapham</font><br/>
Andrew Clapham is a print-based artist and designer having completed his Fine Art (Honours) and currently studying a Masters of Communication and Design at RMIT. Within a print-based practice, Clapham explores the role craft has through merging traditional and contemporary print techniques which can be placed within contemporary design.
Printed textures is a part of a series of experimental screen prints which explores mechanical processes mimicking organically painted surfaces.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Lucy Roleff</font><br/>
After having worked as a freelance illustrator for a few years, I have returned to my formal art training, exploring still life work and portraiture in oils. I am curious about and touch on themes such as growth, decay and ordinary domestic moments.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Ryan McGennisken</font><br/>
Ryan McGennisken’s paintings are constructed through an experimental studio process that intends to defy considered composition and gesture. He paints ‘alla prima’ in the outdoors, in silence, layering with speed, a combination of paint and found non-art materials like rust, motor oil, and dirt. He favours imperfection and seeks unforeseen beauty; adding and deleting marks at every step of the process.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Nicholas Millen</font><br/>
Millen’s paintings are a visual expressions of internal rhythm becoming form. Lines, dots, strokes, colours & gestures begin intuitively and gradually or quickly combine together to form unexpected subject matter(s).
This process becomes durational and although fresh subjects are unearthed, more layers are painted until an abstract history is formed or until the painting reflects something about the loss of clear subjects in the vortex of time, space and inevitable continuum.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Maddison Kitching</font><br/>
My practice has primarily been concerned with commercial representations of the Australian landscape and our relationship to place. Through collage, painting and digital media platforms my work aims to interrogate ideas about Australian national identity.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Mathew Quick</font><br/>
Matthew always painted but managed to distract himself with a few alternative careers. He’s worked as a lecturer, art-director & writer, with his first novel short-listed for the Vogel Literature Award. Featured in BRW as one of Australia’s top 50 artists, in the past few years Matthew’s won, or been a finalist for, 70 national juried art awards. He’s had 14 solo and more than 80 group shows.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Jessica Tse</font><br/>
Jessica Tse has been practicing art in the past decade, in an abstract, experimental, metaphorical and spiritual way.
She uses painting, sculpture, installation, sound and poetry to express her life and vision.<br/><br/>

<font color="black">Michael Peck</font><br/>
Michael Peck participates in a project of world making, creating spaces so intimate that the viewer cannot help but to feel as if they have stumbled upon a scene not meant for their eyes.
There is an uncanny ambiguity as to the intent of his child subjects. The intensity of their concentration is mesmerising but the question lingers: are they innocents engaged in the imaginary games of childhood or survivalists adapting to a world without adult supervision and denied the luxury of play? </font>
